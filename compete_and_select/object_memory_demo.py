We'll have several cluttered scenes, with some shared
objects between them. But yeah, let's just start with
something that forces a memory to be made. Ideally, we
will be able to estimate the uncertainty the robot has,
or the cost of the robot making a mistake, but for now
we will just focus on reactively adding memories based
on errors.
